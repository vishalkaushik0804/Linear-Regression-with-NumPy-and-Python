# Linear-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python

This project is based on Linear Regression with NumPy and Python.
In this project, machine learning is done without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. 
The aim of this project and is to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent and linear regression, of the various learning algorithms by ourselves.
